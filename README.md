## Demo Project Setup

Follow the [NestJS documentation](https://nestjs.com) to for installation

Use the `Nest CLI` to start a new project

```
$ nest new nest-api
``` 

Select `npm` (default) for the package manager (or selectr yarn) when prompted.

```
$ cd nest-api
```

Open the project in code editor of your choice.

Start a server using nodemon

```
$ npm run start:dev
```

Open another terminal window and generate `books module`, `books controller`, and `books service` using the Nest CLI

```
$ nest generate module books
```

```
$ nest generate controller books
```

```
$ nest generate service books
```

I will delete the spec files (`books.controller.spec.ts`, `books.service.spec.ts`, and `app.controller.spec.ts`) simply to make the file structure a little easier to see during the presentation, but you can leave them them if you want to use for testing later.

Create a new file called `books.model.ts` inside the `src/books/` directory and add the following code.

```ts
export class Book {
  constructor(
    public id: string,
    public title: string,
    public price: number,
  ) {}
}
```
